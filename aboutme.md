My name is Josh. I'm a Data Science Student at Lambda School. I'm aiming to improve and start building projects that can help me ony my way to Artificial Intelligence and robotics. Building systems is fun, but ultimately I hope I can help make things that have a physical benefit on people's lives in the long term.
