This is my first project for Lambda School's monthly build week. I think the media presents a hostile view of life in the US; that shootings are happening more frequently than ever, that politicians are manipulating us, and that an excess diet of fried eggs is going to give us cancer. It sounds like other countries are taking note as well, as I've even heard of some warning their citizens of “highly frequent” gun violence. But I don't think death is nearly as common or likely as they believe.

By using data gathered from the CDC on deaths in California I intend to give a clear view on death - albeit a very small subset of the larger USA - and it's general probability against the surviving population as well as it's most common causes. I believe the most likely causes of death are cardiac arrest and motor-vehicle collisions and I'll compare that with what I believe most people would worry about; terrorism and homicide. I intend to show whether or not either view is correct.
