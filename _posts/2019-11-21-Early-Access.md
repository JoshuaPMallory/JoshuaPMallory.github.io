Of the sixty-eight thousand games on Steam about four thousand of them are Early Access, and of those about six hundred have made it to a full release. With a success rate of only about fifteen percent it doesn't seem too bright a concept, though, we don't know the success rate of those game which didn't made a traditional full release nor is there any length of time associated with it.

While there's a scarce few I've seen that actually made it I've also seen some that have turned out impressive like Hollow Knight or Warframe, and I'd like to have been able to know before hand if it had any chance of success. So...


**Is there a way to determine if an Early Access game is actually going to hit 1.0 or not?**

It's important to note that just because a game releases doesn't mean that it's a particularly good one; Duke Nukem Forever was an example of that. However I believe most games will follow approximately the same release length of a traditional one at about three to five years.

I also suspect that most Early Access games will 


# Overview
So, what I'm basically trying to do is make a project that takes a look at the different aspects of Early Access games on steam, and tries to find out if there's any part of it that corresponds to it's chances of actually turning out into a full release
The way I wanna do this is take in my training data and search through all the features to find the ones that have an affect, or make some based on the already existing data
So for example, I took the release dates years and subtracted them from the current year, and that tells us how long it's been since it was released to Early Access
I'd guess that most games would take between 3-5 years to fully release
So what I should see is a few that release early, a few that release late, a majority that release right where I expect, and a majority that still have yet to actually release all along the years
I'm hoping that I can use this to figure out if time is a factor or not



#### Maybe I should block each type of game by it's genre?
We could take each group based on it's genre and run the numbers, normalize them, and compare each genre's chances of releasing.


#### Asset flips
